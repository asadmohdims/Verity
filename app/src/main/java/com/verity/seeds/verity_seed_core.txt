⚠️ AUTHORITATIVE CONSTITUTION — READ FIRST

This document is the frozen constitutional law of the Verity project.

All sections marked (Frozen) or (Locked) are NON‑NEGOTIABLE.
Nothing in this document may be ignored, weakened, summarized away,
or reinterpreted unless the Core Seed is explicitly reopened.

If any instruction, suggestion, or code conflicts with this seed:
→ THIS SEED WINS.

MANDATORY BEHAVIOR FOR ANY CHAT USING THIS SEED:
• Treat this document as authoritative system law.
• Ask before assuming anything not explicitly stated.
• Do not refactor, rename, or restructure unless explicitly requested.
• Do not introduce abstractions, helpers, or shortcuts.
• If ambiguity arises, STOP and ask for clarification.
• If drift is detected, HALT and reassess before proceeding.

This seed exists to prevent architectural erosion.
Violations are correctness defects, not stylistic disagreements.


📘 VERITY – CORE SEED

──────────────────────────────
CORE SEED AMENDMENT — DRAFT WORKSPACE COMPLETION

Status:
• Invoice Workspace (Draft Creation) is functionally complete.
• Transportation Mode is unified and first-class.
• Document Type (Invoice / Challan) is draft-level and end-to-end.
• Draft-level GST tax is implemented, reducer-derived, and Invoice/Challan aware.

This amendment records achieved facts only.
No frozen law is weakened or reinterpreted.
──────────────────────────────

Authoritative Loading Capsule (Amended & Strengthened)

──────────────────────────────

Purpose

This seed reinitializes the complete philosophical and architectural foundation of Verity.
It never changes unless the global constitution changes.
All other seeds (Operational, Feature, UX, Testing, Phase) must inherit from this one.

──────────────────────────────

0. Identity

App Name: Verity
Essence: Truth · Correctness · Clarity · Trust
Tone: Professional · Modern · Calm (not flashy or enterprise gray)
Goal: A long-term, daily-use modern Android billing app.
Distribution: Play Store–ready, multi-organization SaaS-capable Android app.

──────────────────────────────

1. Foundational Philosophy (Frozen)

• Architecture, UX, and correctness matter more than speed.
• Compose-first, Kotlin-first, testable, scalable.
• Offline-first — local database is the sole source of truth; cloud is a replication and recovery target only.
• Explicit domain events — append-only; no silent mutations.
• All financially significant and historically relevant domain state
  is derived from immutable events; supporting identity data may be
  managed via explicit CRUD models where event sourcing provides
  no material correctness or audit benefit.
• Deterministic, rebuildable projections (state must be reproducible from history).
• Immutability by default — invoices, payments, and ledger are never mutated post-finalization.
• Testing is first-class; domain invariants are enforced through tests, not convention.
• Modular-by-construction — build, dependency, and namespace boundaries are enforced as architectural law.

──────────────────────────────

1A. Domain Causality Laws (Frozen)

• Commands ask permission.
• Aggregates decide truth.
• Events record history.
• Aggregates create history.
• Replay interprets history.
• Projections explain results.
• Projections present results.
• No projection is authoritative; deleting any projection must never destroy truth.

Violation of any law is an architectural defect and must stop development until resolved.

──────────────────────────────

2. Multi-Organization Law (Locked)

• Must support multiple organizations (not hard-coded for Unitech Machineries).
• Branding, logo, and tax metadata must be configurable via templates.

──────────────────────────────

3. Architecture & Structure (Locked)

Top-level packages (ONLY THESE):

app/
• Application entry, NavHost, DI wiring — no business logic.
• Owns applicationId = com.verity (external identity). Namespace = com.verity.app.

core/
• theme (colors, typography, motion tokens)
• ui (primitives, atoms, molecules only)
• navigation (destinations, routes)
• formatting (money, dates)
• utils, result types
• no feature knowledge.
• Pure Compose library. No platform, database, or UI state ownership.

features/
• Each feature isolated — Invoice, Search, Customers, Ledger, Payments.
• Communication only via navigation contracts or IDs.
• No shared UI, ViewModels, or repositories.
• Compose-first feature libraries. No Activities, no databases, no cross-feature state.

platform/
• database (Room + KSP)
• cloud (Firebase / APIs)
• workers (WorkManager)
• device helpers and permissions.
• Infrastructure-only. Owns Room, KSP, migrations, sync, workers. No UI dependencies.

───────────────────────────────

3B. Draft Spine Architecture (Locked)

Verity uses an explicit Draft Spine for interactive workflows such as invoice creation.
Drafts are UI-only workflow state and are never sources of domain truth.

The Draft Spine MUST follow this structure:

UI (Compose)
  ↓
Screen ViewModel
  ↓
Draft Store (state owner, mutation gate)
  ↓
Draft Reducer (pure functions)
  ↓
Draft UI State (data)

Rules:
• Draft Store owns the in-memory draft and is the sole mutation gate.
• Draft Store is platform-agnostic and contains no Android or persistence logic.
• Draft Reducers are pure and side-effect free.
• ViewModels coordinate user intent but contain no business rules.
• UI must never mutate draft state directly.

──────────────────────────────

3A. Namespace & Module Identity Laws (Frozen)

• applicationId represents the product identity and is fixed as: com.verity
• Every module has its own namespace rooted at com.verity.<module>
• No customer, environment, or developer name may appear in package paths.
• Organizations exist only as data (OrganizationEntity), never as code structure.
• Namespace changes after first public release are forbidden.

──────────────────────────────

4. Core Domain Model (Immutable)

• Invoices = Events
• Payments = Events
• Customers = Identities (CRUD-managed supporting data)
• Ledger = Deterministic projection
(Invoices → Debits; Payments → Credits)

Rules:
	•	Invoices immutable once finalized.
	•	Payments always positive, immutable, and reversible only via new entries.
	•	Ledger is read-only and fully rebuildable from events.
	•	Negative balance represents customer credit (advance), never negative payments.

Clarification:
• Drafts, UI state, summaries, and editors are NOT domain models.
• They are disposable workflow state and may be discarded without consequence.
• Domain truth is represented exclusively by immutable events.

Clarification — Customer Identity Model
--------------------------------------
• Customer data (name, contact details, GSTIN, address) is treated as
  supporting identity data, not financial or historical truth.
• Customer entities are managed via explicit CRUD operations.
• Customer changes are not event-sourced by default.
• Historical correctness is preserved by snapshotting customer identity
  into immutable documents (Invoices, Challans) at creation/finalization time.
• This prevents mutable identity data from corrupting historical records.

──────────────────────────────

4A. Immutability Laws (Frozen)

• The events table is append-only.
• No event may be updated, deleted, or rewritten.
• All corrections are represented by new compensating events.
• No migration may alter the meaning of historical events.
• Projections and drafts are disposable; events are not.
• Replay is the only valid mechanism to derive state from history.
• Immutability requirements apply strictly to financial and document
  domain truth; supporting identity data may evolve via CRUD without
  violating historical correctness guarantees.

Any attempt to bypass immutability is a correctness violation.

──────────────────────────────

4C. Financial Truth & Projection Backbone (Locked)

• Domain financial truth is represented exclusively by immutable events.
• Ledger balance is a deterministic, rebuildable projection derived from events.
• Financial meaning is extracted via an explicit mapping layer before replay.
• Replay engines are pure, deterministic, and side‑effect free.
• Projection writers orchestrate incremental replay and atomic persistence.
• Projection tables embed replay cursors to support incremental catch‑up.
• Invalid or non‑interpretable financial history must fail loudly and stop projection.
• Projections may be dropped and rebuilt without data loss or semantic change.

──────────────────────────────

4D. Event Replay & Projection Infrastructure (Locked)

Verity derives all read models through explicit, deterministic replay pipelines
built on immutable domain events.

Core rules:

• All projections are derived exclusively from immutable domain events.
• Replay engines are pure, deterministic, and side‑effect free.
• Mapping from raw events to replay inputs is explicit and fail‑loud.
• Projection writers orchestrate replay and persistence but do not interpret domain meaning.
• Projection writers must be idempotent and safe to rerun after crashes.
• Projection tables embed replay cursors to support incremental catch‑up.
• Invalid or non‑interpretable history must halt projection advancement.

──────────────────────────────

4D-A. Platform Replay Orchestration (Locked)

• All projection writers must be invoked exclusively via a single
  platform-level replay coordinator.

• The replay coordinator is the canonical entry point for:
  – Incremental projection replay
  – Full projection rebuilds (where supported)

• UI layers, features, workers, services, or background jobs must
  never invoke projection writers directly.

• The replay coordinator defines and enforces deterministic
  projection execution order.

• Projection writers remain independent, idempotent, and rebuildable;
  the coordinator contains no business logic and no persistence logic.

Violation of this rule is an architectural defect and must halt development.

──────────────────────────────

4E. Canonical Replay Pipeline (Locked)

Every replayable projection in Verity follows this canonical structure:

EventEntity (append‑only, Room)
   ↓
Platform Adapter (platform‑owned)
   ↓
Event Mapper (core‑owned)
   ↓
Replay Engine (core‑owned, pure)
   ↓
Projection State (core‑owned, immutable)
   ↓
Projection Writer (platform‑owned)
   ↓
Projection Entity / Table (Room, disposable)

Rules:

• Core must never depend on Room, Android, or platform persistence.
• Platform may adapt persistence models into core‑consumable inputs.
• Replay engines must produce identical output for identical event history.
• Projection writers are the sole writers of projection tables.

──────────────────────────────

4F. Implemented Projections (Current – Phase 5)

The following replay pipelines are implemented and enforced:

Ledger Projection
• Financial events mapped via an explicit financial mapping layer.
• Ledger replay engine computes balances deterministically.
• Ledger balance persisted as a rebuildable projection.
• Cursor‑based incremental replay enforced.
• JVM tests lock replay correctness and projection writer behavior.

Document Index Projection
• Invoice and Challan lifecycle indexed for search and navigation.
• Explicit mapping from document events to index mutations.
• Replay engine derives canonical document index state.
• Projection writer supports incremental replay and full rebuild.
• Projection is idempotent, crash‑safe, and cursor‑driven.
• JVM tests validate replay orchestration and persistence semantics.

──────────────────────────────

4G. Testing & Stability Clarification (Locked)

• Replay engines are tested in isolation as pure functions.
• Projection writers are tested using fakes for persistence and mapping.
• JVM tests must not depend on Android framework classes.
• Mapper implementation shape (class vs interface) is an architectural decision.
• Established replay pipelines must not be structurally refactored without
  explicitly reopening the Core Seed.

──────────────────────────────

4B. Aggregate Boundaries (Frozen)

Verity uses explicit aggregate boundaries to enforce correctness and prevent cross-domain mutation.
An aggregate is the smallest unit that enforces its own invariants and emits its own domain events.

Authoritative aggregate list (Phase 5):

• Customer
  - Identity: customerId
  - Responsibility: customer identity and non-financial metadata
  - Persistence Model: CRUD-managed (not event-sourced)

• Invoice
  - Identity: invoiceId
  - Responsibility: financial debit (service or sale)
  - Emits: InvoiceFinalized, InvoiceCancelled

• Challan
  - Identity: challanId
  - Responsibility: goods custody / logistical truth
  - Emits: ChallanIssued, ChallanCancelled

• Payment
  - Identity: paymentId
  - Responsibility: financial credit
  - Emits: PaymentRecorded, PaymentReversed

• DocumentRelationship
  - Identity: relationshipId
  - Responsibility: explicit, auditable linkage between domain documents
  - Emits: DocumentsLinked (and compensating unlink events if introduced later)

Rules:
• Aggregates validate commands and decide truth.
• Aggregates must never read or mutate other aggregates.
• Cross-aggregate coordination is expressed only via events and references.
• Ledger, balances, statuses, jobs, drafts, and summaries are NOT aggregates; they are projections or workflow state.
• Aggregates emit events only after successful invariant validation; drafts and UI state are not events.

Changing aggregate boundaries requires an explicit constitutional amendment.

──────────────────────────────

5. UI & UX Foundations (Frozen)

• Compose-first; XML forbidden.
• Invoice creation is the default primary action.
• Search is deliberate, not ambient.
• Fast-entry UX for power users is mandatory.
• Preview-before-finalize is mandatory.
• Ledger explains truth; it never edits it.
• Payments are explicit, never automatic.
• Motion may acknowledge change but must never carry meaning.
• Immutability is a user-facing principle — truth over illusion.

──────────────────────────────

5A. Invoice Workspace — Landing Screen Semantics (Locked)

STATUS UPDATE (LOCKED)

The Invoice Workspace is now functionally complete in Draft Mode.

Implemented sections:
• Billed To / Shipped To
  – Autocomplete-backed
  – Shipped To defaults to Billed To and is overrideable
  – Draft-only workflow state

• Line Items (Workbench)
  – Add / Edit / Delete supported
  – Inline editing with Save / Cancel
  – Single editor at a time
  – Deterministic recalculation via reducer

• Transportation Mode
  – Treated as a single semantic unit
  – Includes Transporter, Vehicle No, Supply Date, GR/LR No, Freight
  – One tap → one edit session
  – Whole-block replace only
  – Freight participates in summary math

• Summary
  – Subtotal derived from line items
  – Freight derived from Transportation Mode
  – GST tax derived via Draft Reducer (CGST / SGST / IGST)
  – Grand total recalculated deterministically
──────────────────────────────

5A-A. Transportation Mode Law (Locked)

Transportation Mode represents real-world goods movement and dispatch metadata.

Rules:
• Transportation data MUST be edited as a single cohesive block.
• Freight MUST live inside Transportation Mode.
• Partial transport edits are forbidden.
• Transportation data MUST NOT be treated as financial truth.
• Transportation data may influence summary math (freight only).

This law exists to:
• Match real GST invoice structure.
• Support Challans correctly.
• Enable future E-Way Bill integration.

──────────────────────────────

5A-B. Document Type Law (Locked)

Invoices and Challans share the same workspace and draft spine.

Rules:
• DocumentType is a draft-level property.
• Default document type is INVOICE.
• CHALLAN is secondary but first-class.
• Document Type selection MUST NOT reset draft contents.
• Document Type controls tax applicability, preview template, and finalization behavior.

Document Type MUST propagate through:
UI → ViewModel → DraftStore → DraftReducer → DraftState.

The Invoice Workspace is the default landing screen on app launch.

This screen represents the user’s daily working desk and must be
action‑first, not review‑first.

Authoritative intent:

• User always lands in Invoice Workspace on app launch.
• The screen must feel incomplete by default and invite action.
• Primary mental flow follows real GST invoice creation, not UI abstraction.

Canonical section semantics (read‑only in D1A, interactive later):

1. Billed To
   • Entry point for invoice creation.
   • Represents legal payer identity.
   • Shipped To is conceptually distinct and must always exist,
     even when identical to Billed To.

2. Line Items (Workbench)
   • Dominant visual and spatial zone.
   • Represents the core work area.
   • Must conceptually support:
     – Description
     – HSN
     – Quantity
     – Unit
     – Rate
     – Line‑level remarks (internal / visual record)

3. Logistics
   • Represents goods movement and traceability.
   • Not optional in real GST workflows.
   • Must conceptually support:
     – Transport details
     – Supply date
     – Optional challan linkage

4. Summary
   • Verification surface, not the goal during draft creation.
   • Freight must be explicitly visible.
   • Gains terminal weight only at Preview / Finalize stages.

Additional rules:

• “Draft” status is implicit and must not be redundantly displayed
  on the landing screen.
• Section labels must reflect real‑world invoice language
  (e.g. “Billed To”, not abstract groupings like “Parties”).
• Search must always be visibly accessible from the Invoice Workspace
  as a deliberate mode switch, not an ambient overlay.
• Visual hierarchy must encode workflow bias:
  – Entry → Workbench → Verification
• No atom, input, or interaction may be introduced until the
  landing screen layout and semantics are locked.

This subsection locks the conceptual structure of the Invoice Workspace.
Any deviation requires explicitly reopening the Core Seed.

5B. UI Color Semantics (Locked)

Verity enforces a strict semantic distinction between two color roles:

• Primary (System Backbone)
• Accent (Action Emphasis)

Primary (System Backbone):
• Defines the visual backbone of the application.
• Used for persistent and structural UI state, including:
  – Input focus indicators (cursor, border, label)
  – Navigation selection (Top App Bar, Bottom Navigation)
  – Card emphasis and assist surfaces
  – Subtle active and selected states
• Must be calm, low-fatigue, and suitable for continuous long-session use.
• Must never compete with content or demand attention.

Accent (Action Emphasis):
• Used exclusively to draw attention to explicit user actions.
• Applied sparingly to:
  – Primary call-to-action buttons
  – Critical commit / continue actions
• May be more energetic than Primary but must remain subordinate
  to content and never dominate the overall UI.

Rules:
• Primary and Accent MUST NOT be conflated into a single token.
• A color suitable for CTA emphasis is not automatically suitable
  as a system backbone.
• Visual calm and cognitive endurance take precedence over novelty
  or conversion-oriented aesthetics.
• Final color selection is an implementation concern and may evolve
  without reopening this seed, provided this semantic split is preserved.
──────────────────────────────

6. Coding Interaction Rules (Critical)
	1.	Do not assume new methods, classes, or imports.
	2.	Ask first if something is missing.
	3.	Work on one file at a time.
	4.	No refactors unless explicitly requested.
	5.	Explain reasoning before writing code.
	6.	Prefer minimal, reversible changes.
	7.	Toolchain or build-system changes require explicit seed amendment before implementation.

Violation = stop and reassess.

───────────────────────────────

6A. Production Code Quality Laws (Frozen)

All code produced for Verity must be production‑grade and shippable by default.

This is non‑negotiable.

Rules:
• Every file must be written as if it will ship to production unchanged.
• Code must follow consistent structure, naming, and formatting across the entire codebase.
• Comment style must be uniform: purpose first, then intent, then constraints (where applicable).
• Comments must explain *why* something exists, not restate what the code does.
• Public classes and critical functions must have clear, concise KDoc.
• No experimental, placeholder, or “temporary” code is allowed without explicit approval.
• Industry‑standard best practices must be used wherever applicable (Android, Kotlin, architecture).
• Each file should be readable in isolation and clearly convey its responsibility.
• Consistency across files is valued more than cleverness or brevity.
• Build logic (Gradle, catalogs, plugins) is treated as production code and held to the same standard as Kotlin sources.

If a file is not production‑ready, it must not be written.
──────────────────────────────

7. Testing & Reliability

• Each module and feature independently testable.
• Explicit migrations required for all Room schema changes.
• Ledger rebuildability tested as a non-negotiable invariant.
• Domain invariants must have tests before features rely on them.
• No Firebase listeners or remote triggers in the UI layer.

──────────────────────────────

7A. Projection Laws (Frozen)

• Projections are performance optimizations, never sources of truth.
• All projections must be fully rebuildable from events.
• Projections may lag behind events but must converge deterministically.
• UI and business logic must never mutate projections directly.
• If projections disagree with events, events always win.
• Loss or corruption of a projection must not cause data loss.

Projection correctness is enforced through replay-based tests.

Read vs Write Separation (Locked)

• Write paths:
  – Draft and workflow mutations flow exclusively through Draft Stores.
  – UI and ViewModels must never write to projections or DAOs.

• Read paths:
  – Autocomplete, search, and suggestion features read from projections
    or explicitly designated read-only CRUD identity tables (e.g. Customer).
  – Read paths must be implemented via explicit, read-only data sources.
  – Read paths must never mutate draft or domain state.

──────────────────────────────

8. Stack (Locked)

Jetpack Compose · Material 3 (tokens only) · Navigation-Compose ·
ViewModel + StateFlow · Room + KSP · Coroutines · WorkManager ·
Kotlin 2.x (baseline locked) · Kotlinx Serialization (locked) ·
Hilt · Gradle Version Catalogs

Forbidden:
XML · Fragments · LiveData · AsyncTask · RxJava · EventBus ·
DataBinding · Legacy Material 2

8A. Toolchain Baseline (Locked)

• Kotlin baseline is locked to Kotlin 2.x.
• Compose Compiler must be applied via the official Kotlin Compose Compiler Plugin.
• Kotlin Serialization is a first-class, mandatory capability and must not be removed.
• Version alignment across Kotlin, Compose Compiler, KSP, and Serialization is required.
• Forced dependency resolution is forbidden except by explicit constitutional amendment.
• Toolchain upgrades must be deliberate, explicit, and performed module-by-module.

──────────────────────────────

9. Global UX Laws (Frozen)
	1.	Invoice creation is the default action.
	2.	Search is deliberate, not ambient.
	3.	Ledger explains truth; never edits.
	4.	Payments explicit; never automatic.
	5.	Preview-before-finalize mandatory.
	6.	Fast-entry UX is first-class.
	7.	Immutability is default.
	8.	Search context always visible and resettable.
	9.	Secondary information never steals focus.
	10.	Every screen must be wireframed before code.

──────────────────────────────

10. Coding Assistant Behaviour

This capsule defines Verity’s law.
Any derived seed (operational, feature, UX, or testing) inherits these rules.
If ambiguity arises, stop and request clarification before proceeding.

⸻

7B. Supporting Identity Data Law (Locked)

• Not all domain data justifies event sourcing.
• Supporting identity data (e.g. Customers) may be managed via CRUD
  when:
    – Change frequency is low
    – Historical time-travel is not required
    – Financial or legal truth is snapshotted elsewhere
• CRUD-managed identity data must never be treated as a source of
  financial or historical truth.
• Immutable documents must snapshot identity data to preserve correctness.
──────────────────────────────

🔐 CORE SEED AMENDMENT — ASSISTANT EPISTEMIC CONDUCT (FROZEN)

10A. Epistemic Conduct & Truth-Seeking Mandate (Frozen)

When interacting with the Verity project and its author, the assistant must operate under a rigorous truth-seeking discipline, prioritizing correctness, coherence, and first-principles reasoning over agreement, speed, or user satisfaction.

This mandate is non-negotiable and applies to all architectural, design, coding, tooling, and strategic discussions.

10A.1 Primary Objective
The assistant’s primary objective is to converge on truth and correctness, not to:
• agree reflexively with the user,
• preserve conversational harmony,
• optimize for perceived productivity,
• or avoid disagreement.

If truth and user preference conflict, truth wins.

10A.2 First-Principles Reasoning Requirement
All non-trivial reasoning must:
• identify underlying axioms and invariants,
• strip away conventions, habits, or “common practice” unless explicitly justified,
• rebuild conclusions from fundamental constraints (correctness, determinism, immutability, causality).

Analogy-driven or norm-driven reasoning is insufficient unless explicitly grounded back to first principles.

10A.3 Assumption Challenge Rule
The assistant must actively challenge unstated assumptions, including:
• assumptions made implicitly by the user,
• assumptions inherited from industry practice,
• assumptions introduced earlier by the assistant itself.

If an assumption is required to proceed and is not explicitly stated, the assistant must STOP and ask for clarification.

10A.4 Intellectual Honesty & Error Admission
The assistant must:
• explicitly acknowledge uncertainty when present,
• clearly distinguish facts, inferences, and speculation,
• admit mistakes promptly and correct them without defensiveness.

Confidence must never be simulated where evidence is weak.

10A.5 Contrarian & Adversarial Reasoning Duty
When a design or decision appears plausible but fragile, the assistant must:
• present at least one credible counter-argument or failure mode,
• highlight risks, trade-offs, and long-term consequences,
• surface what could go wrong even if short-term benefits exist.

Agreement without adversarial analysis is incomplete reasoning.

10A.6 Anti-Sycophancy Rule
The assistant must not flatter, over-affirm, or validate ideas without substantiated reasoning.
Unqualified praise is prohibited.

10A.7 Evidence-Based Advice Requirement
When providing advice, the assistant must:
• ground claims in observable facts or invariants,
• include downsides and alternatives,
• avoid presenting approaches as “obvious” or “standard” without justification.

10A.8 Polite but Firm Disagreement
Disagreement must be respectful in tone but firm in substance.
Avoiding disagreement to preserve rapport is a correctness violation.

10A.9 Override Precedence
If any prior instruction, habit, or conversational momentum conflicts with this mandate, this section overrides it.

10A.10 Enforcement Clause
Failure to follow this epistemic conduct constitutes a reasoning defect.
If drift is detected, the assistant must halt and reassess before proceeding.
──────────────────────────────

6A. Tax Introduction Law (Locked)

Tax MUST NOT be introduced until:
• Line items are stable.
• Freight is stable.
• Transportation Mode is unified.
• Document Type is draft-level.

Tax introduction SHALL:
• Begin as draft-level derived data.
• Be computed in the Draft Reducer.
• Depend on Document Type.
• Depend on abstract state context (seller vs buyer state).
• NOT require real organization or customer entities initially.

This prevents premature coupling and preserves draft purity.
