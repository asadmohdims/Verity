# VERITY – OPERATIONAL SEED
Inherits from: verity_seed_core.txt

Phase: 5 – Data, Sync, Testing & Production Prep
Phase Status:
    • 0 – Reset & Intent ✅
    • 1 – Business & Domain Fundamentals ✅
    • 2 – Architecture Blueprint ✅
    • 3 – UX Laws, Design System & Wireframes ✅
    • 4 – Implementation Foundations ✅ (LOCKED)
    • 5 – Data, Sync, Testing & Production Prep 🔄 ACTIVE (Domain Architecture Locked)

──────────────────────────────────────
Current Focus:
Domain correctness, data modeling, invariants, migrations, and test enforcement.
UI work is frozen unless directly required by data or correctness.
• Aggregate boundaries, command→event flow, and replay architecture are locked.
• Domain causality, immutability, and projection laws are constitutionally enforced.
• Performance strategy defined via checkpointed projections (no full replay on navigation).

──────────────────────────────────────
Scope:
• Domain-first design (events, invariants, projections).
• Local database (Room) as the sole source of truth.
• Explicit migrations before schema changes.
• Offline-first sync design (cloud as replication target only).
• Test-first enforcement of domain invariants.
• No speculative UI or UX changes.
• Event Sourcing applied surgically to financial and logistical domain truth only.
• Projections treated strictly as rebuildable performance caches.
• Replay-first design with incremental (delta-based) rebuilds for scalability.

──────────────────────────────────────
Current Working Components:
core/domain/
    ├─ events (Invoice, Payment, Customer lifecycle events)
    ├─ invariants (ledger, balance, immutability rules)

platform/database/
    ├─ Room entities & DAOs
    ├─ Explicit migrations (versioned, tested)

platform/cloud/
    ├─ Sync boundaries & replication logic (no UI coupling)

tests/
    ├─ Domain invariant tests
    ├─ Ledger rebuild tests
    ├─ Migration tests

core/replay/
    ├─ Pure replay engine (events → in-memory state)
    ├─ Deterministic ledger computation

──────────────────────────────────────
Operational Laws (Frozen for Phase 5)
• Local database is the single source of truth.
• All state changes occur via append-only domain events.
• Projections must be fully rebuildable from events.
• No silent data mutation or in-place edits.
• Migrations are mandatory and written before schema changes.
• UI may not compensate for data inconsistency.
• Cloud sync may lag, replay, or fail without corrupting truth.
• Commands express intent; only aggregates may emit domain events.
• Replay explains history; it must never decide or mutate truth.
• Projection tables may be dropped and rebuilt at any time without data loss.
• Performance optimizations must not introduce new sources of truth.

──────────────────────────────────────
Behavioural Laws for the Assistant:
• Always confirm invariants before proposing data models.
• No Room entities without migration strategy.
• No sync logic without failure and replay semantics.
• Prefer tests and invariants before feature code.
• Stop immediately if correctness is compromised.

──────────────────────────────────────
Current Deliverable:
• Event naming, versioning, and aggregate boundaries finalized.
• Append-only event storage model defined and locked.
• Replay engine and projection persistence strategy defined.
• In-memory invariant tests specified as correctness gate.
• Ready to begin concrete implementation (EventEntity, EventDao, replay engine).
